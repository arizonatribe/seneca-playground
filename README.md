# Seneca Playground

This is a scratch project that I've toyed with for a year, trying to see how well a NodeJS based microservice architecture can scale with the [Seneca](https://senecajs.org) framework.

At the time, the only book available that covered this framework was David Gonzalez [Developing Microservices with Node.js](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/developing-microservices-nodejs), so there are a couple of microservices in this project initially based on some of his examples. That book was probably rushed into production and was fraught with errata, so what began as fixes for non-working examples turned into a deeper "road test" of those ideas, once I developed a good rhythmn with *Seneca*. Now though, I would highly recommend [the book by Richard Rodger](https://www.manning.com/books/the-tao-of-microservices) (the author of the Seneca.js framework) which was published through [manning.com](https://www.manning.com) in Summer of 2017. I found it difficult to learn Seneca from his online articles the Seneca.js website however I've been extremely happy with his book and would say he's impressed me as one of the more fluid and intuitive authors to read in tech.
